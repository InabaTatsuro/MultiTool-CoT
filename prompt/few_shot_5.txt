Q: How many moles of Chlorine are required to react with 3 moles of Methane to form 3 moles of Dichloromethane along with 6 moles of Hydrochrolic acid
A: First, use the chemical reaction predictor to determine the chemical equation for the reaction.
Reactants: ?Cl2, 3CH4
Products: 3CH2Cl2, 6HCl
<< Chemical reaction predictor >>
6Cl2 + 3CH4 → 3CH2Cl2 + 6HCl

Therefore, 6 moles of Chlorine are required.

Q: Find the mass percentage of N in Dinitrogen pentoxide
A: First, use the molar mass list to determine the molar mass of Dinitrogen pentoxide.
N2O5 << Molar mass list >> 108 g/mol

Second, use the molar mass list to determine the molar mass of N.
N << Molar mass list >> 14 g/mol

Third, use the calculator to calculate the mass percentage of N in Dinitrogen pentoxide. 
14 x 2 / 108 x 100 = << Calculator >> 25.93

Therefore, the mass percentage of N in Dinitrogen pentoxide is 25.93%.

Q: Find the mass percentage of B in H3BO3.
A: First, use the molar mass list to determine the molar mass of H3BO3.
H3BO3 << Molar mass list >> 62 g/mol

Second, use the molar mass list to determine the molar mass of B.
B << Molar mass list >> 11 g/mol

Third, use the calculator to calculate the mass percentage of B in H3BO3
10.81 / 61 x 100 = << Calculator >> 17.74

Therefore, the mass percentage of B in H3BO3 is 17.74%.

Q: Find the amount of BaO that is required to react with 3 moles of H2O to form 3 moles of Ba(OH)2
A: First, use the chemical reaction predictor to determine the chemical equation for the reaction.
Reactants: ?BaO, 3H2O
Products: 3Ba(OH)2
<< Chemical reaction predictor >>
3BaO + 3H2O → 3Ba(OH)2

Second, use the molar mass lists to determine the molar mass of BaO.
BaO << Molar mass list >> 153 g/mol

Third, use the calculator to calculate the amount of 3 moles of BaO.
3 x 153 = << Calculator >> 459

Therefore, 459 g of BaO is required.

Q: Find the amount of H2O formed on combining 3 moles of NaOH and 3 moles of H2SO4
A: First, use the chemical reaction predictor to determine the chemical equation for the reaction.
Reactants: 3NaOH, 3H2SO4
Products: ?H2O, 3NaHSO4
<< Chemical reaction predictor >>
3NaOH + 3H2SO4 → 3NaHSO4 + 3H2O

Second, use the molar mass list to determine the molar mass of H2O.
H2O << Molar mass list >> 18 g/mol

Third, use the calculator to calculate the amount of 6 moles of H2O.
3 x 18 = << Calculator >> 54

Therefore, 54 g of H2O is formed.
